# Robot Perception

So far, we have programmed motion in our bots in a blind fashion. We assumed that we know the environment and the bot moves in that known environment.

However, in real-life situations, it s given that the bot must be able to "see" its surroundings, extract useful information, plan its path and actions.

This is called ***Robot Perception***.

This week, we will be looking at ***OpenCV*** which is a library for ***Computer Vision***.

Its a library containing utilities for obtaining, processing, analysing and understanding digital images.

However easy it sounds, CV can be a challenging and difficult task but thanks to research in the field for the last 20 years, its now easier and the most popular library is OpenCV.
